</h2>
<p>To get your very first demo tutorial up online, you’re going to need
to take 10 simple steps. I’ll list them here quickly, and then deal with
each step in detail, one by one.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create your own GitHub Organization.</li>
<li>Fork the <a
href="https://github.com/HTM-Elves/HTM-Elves.github.io">HTM-Elves
repository</a> into your new Organization.</li>
<li>Use GitHub Pages to publish your new fork</li>
<li>Clone your fork to your local computer</li>
<li>Install Pandoc and Watchman locally</li>
<li>Use HTM-Elves to generate a Demo tutorial automatically</li>
<li>Create a new GitHub repository inside your new Organization for this
demo tutorial</li>
<li>Set the <code>origin</code> for your new local repository to the URL
of your new GitHub repository</li>
<li>Push your local repository to GitHub</li>
<li>Use GitHub Pages to publish this new tutorial repository for the
world to see.</li>
</ol>
<details class="tip" open>
<summary>
Going with the Flow
</summary>
<p>You won’t actually have to write a tutorial of your own at this
stage. You’ll just be learning the workflow. A second tutorial will
provide you with tips and tricks for <a
href="https://htm-elves.github.io/Writing-Your-Own-Tutorials/">Writing
Your Own Tutorials</a>.</p>
</details>
<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>
Step by Step
</summary>
<p>The following sections will describe in detail how to manage each of
the steps listed above. Later, I’ll describe a number of techniques to
simplify the writing process itself.</p>
</details>
</section>
<section id="create-your-organization" aria-labelledby="create-your-organization" data-item="Create Your Organization">
<h2>
<a href="#create-your-organization">Create Your Own Organization</a>
</h2>
<p>Each tutorial you create will be published from a GitHub repository.
To maintain a consistent look and feel, each tutorial repository will
share assets, CSS files and JavaScript files with all the others. The
HTM-Elves project assumes that you will be storing all your tutorials in
a specific GitHub Organization.</p>
<p>To create a GitHub Organization:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Log in to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></p></li>
<li><p>Click on your Profile icon in the top right corner</p></li>
<li><p>In the drop-down menu that opens, select <a
href="https://github.com/settings/organizations">Your Organazations</a>
<img src="images/YourOrganizations.webp"
alt="Your Organizations" /></p></li>
<li><p>Find the New Organization button at the top of the list of
organizations that you belong to, and click on it. <img
src="images/NewOrganization.webp" alt="New Organization" /></p></li>
<li><p>On the next page, choose the Free plan <img
src="images/FreeOrganization.webp" alt="Free Organization" /></p></li>
<li><p>You’ll get a form to fill in. Unless you really want to pay for
it, be sure to deselect the GitHub CoPilot checkbox. <img
src="images/SetUpOrganization.webp"
alt="Set Up Organization" /></p></li>
<li><p>When you have given all the necessary details and accepted the
terms of service, you’ll be able to click on the green Next
button</p></li>
<li><p>The next page allows you to invite other GitHub members to join
your Organization. If you don’t add any names the Complete Setup button
makes you skip ahead to the home page of your new Organization. <img
src="images/SkipStep.webp" alt="Skip Step" /></p></li>
</ol>
<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>
Ready to Tap the Source
</summary>
<p>When GitHub has completed the setup for you, you should find yourself
on a page that tells you “We think you’re gonna like it here”. Now you
are ready to convert your new Organization into a source of
tutorials.</p>
</details>
</section>
<section id="fork-htm-elves" aria-labelledby="fork-htm-elves" data-item="Fork HTM-Elves">
<h2>
<a href="#fork-htm-elves">Fork HTM-Elves to your New Organization</a>
</h2>
<p>The <a
href="https://github.com/orgs/HTM-Elves/repositories">HTM-Elves.github.io
repository</a> contains all the tools that you will need both on GitHub
and on your local development computer.</p>
<p>On GitHub, it will provide the CSS, JavaScript and icon files that
will be public by all your online tutorials. On your development
computer, it will provide scripts to automate your tutorial creation
process.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to create a <em>fork</em> of <a
href="https://HTM-Elves.github.io">HTM-Elves.github.io repository</a> in
your new GitHub Organization.</p>
<details class="note" open>
<summary>
Forks and Clones
</summary>
<p>When you clone a GitHub repository, you create an identical copy of
the files on your local computer. When you <em>fork</em> a GitHub
repository, you create an identical copy of the files <em>in a different
account on GitHub</em>. If you are the owner of the account, then you
have full control of your newly forked repository.</p>
<p>To work with your forked repository, you will still need to clone it
to your development computer, just as you are used to doing.</p>
</details>
<p>To create your own fork of <code>HTM-Elves.github.io</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Visit <a href="https://github.com/HTM-Elves/HTM-Elves.github.io">the
HTM-Elves.github.io repository page</a></li>
<li>Find the Fork button, click on the contextual menu button, and
select Create A New Fork <img src="images/CreateFork.webp"
alt="Create a New Fork" /></li>
<li>A new page will open.
<ul>
<li>From the Owner contextual menu, choose the name of the Organization
that you have just created.</li>
<li>In the Repository Name field, enter the exact name of the
Organization that you have just created, followed by
<code>.github.io</code>. For example, if you created an Organization
called “MyTutorials”, then the repository name <strong>must</strong> be
“MyTutorials.github.io” (case is not important). This tells GitHub to
use this repository to create <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites">the
home page for your Organization</a>. If the following steps fail to work
for you, check that you have named your repository correctly. <img
src="images/NewFork.webp"
alt="Select Owner and Set Name of Fork" /></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>
A Fork with Two Roles
</summary>
<p>You can now use <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">GitHub
Pages</a> to generate an online page for your tutorials Organization
from your forked repository. You can also clone the repository to your
development computer, and use it to generate tutorial repositories for
your Organization.</p>
<p>These roles will be treated in the next sections.</p>
</details>
</section>
<section id="publish-your-fork" aria-labelledby="publish-your-fork" data-item="Publish Your Fork">
<h2>
<a href="#publish-your-fork">Publish Your Fork on GitHub</a>
</h2>
<p>At the end of the previous step, your should find yourself on the
home page of your newly-forked repository. Notice that there is a file
called <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/index.webp" alt="The index.html file" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The index.html file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you use GitHub Pages to publish your newly-forked repository, it
is this <code>index.html</code> file which will be used to create the
home page. The repository also contains a <code>private/</code>
directory which contains a script, a CSS file and a JSON file that will
be used to customize the <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<p>The <code>public/</code> directory contains files that can be used by
future repositories that you will create for your tutorials.</p>
<p>To publish the repository:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the Settings tab at the top right of the page. (You may
have to click on a <code>...</code> button if the page is too narrow to
show all the tabs.)</li>
<li>In the menu column on the left, click on the Pages link</li>
<li>In the Build and Deployment section, make sure that the
<code>main</code> branch is selected, and choose the
<code>/(root)</code> directory as the source.</li>
<li>Click on Save</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="images/GitHubPages.webp" alt="Publish with GitHub Pages" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Publish with GitHub Pages</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>GitHub will queue your publish request, so you may have to wait a few
minutes before the new page is ready. You should find it at
<code>https://MyTutorials.github.io</code> (where you replace
<code>MyTutorials</code> with the actual name of your new
Organization).</p>
<p>The home page of your new Organization should look something like
this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Welcome.webp" alt="Welcome to MyTutorials" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Welcome to MyTutorials</figcaption>
</figure>
<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>
Placeholder Tutorials
</summary>
<p>The default home page is just a placeholder. It provides some dummy
links to tutorials that you haven’t written yet. They will highlight as
you roll your mouse over them, but they will not take you anywhere. You
will see later how you can customize this page.</p>
<p>For now, this page’s existence proves two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>You succeeded in using GitHub Pages to publish a home page for your
new organization</li>
<li>The files in the <code>public/</code> folder are accessible to the
Organization as a whole. The icons beside each dummy tutorial link are
stored inside the <code>public/</code> folder, and the
<code>index.html</code> file in at the root of your repository is able
to show them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next steps , you’ll see how to create a Demo tutorial and
publish it to your new Organization.</p>
</details>
</section>
<section id="clone-your-fork" aria-labelledby="clone-your-fork" data-item="Clone Your Fork">
<h2>
<a href="#clone-your-fork">Clone Your Fork to your Development
Computer</a>
</h2>
<p>For now, everything you have done has been on the GitHub site. Now
it’s time to make a clone of your <code>MyTutorial.github.io</code>
repository on your local computer. This will allow you to generate a
demo tutorial and publish it.</p>
<p>To clone your forked repository to your development computer:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On the home page of your new repository, click on the green Code
button and copy the link to the repository. <img
src="images/CloneFork.webp" alt="Clone your Fork" /></p></li>
<li><p>On the desktop of your computer, create a new folder which you
will use to hold all the repositories for your tutorials Organization.
I’ll simply call mine <code>MyTutorials</code>, like the name of my
Organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Open this new folder with VS Code, and open a new Terminal, type
<code>git clone</code> and then paste the link you have just
copied.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the Enter key <img src="images/LocalClone.webp"
alt="Clone Locally" /></p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="whats-in-the-repository">What’s in the Repository</h3>
<p>To explore the contents of your repository you can 1. Type
<code>code -r M</code> then press the Tab key. (If your repository is
not called <code>MyTutorials</code>, just type the first letter of your
repository name instead of the <code>M</code>). Pressing the Tab key
will make the Terminal autocomplete the name of the folder that has just
been created. 2. Press Enter 3. In VS Code’s Explorer open up all the
subfolders, so you can see their contents. I’ll explain these in due
course. 4. Click on <code>package.json</code></p>

<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>
Scripts and Dependencise
</summary>
<p>The <code>package.json</code> file acts as the command centre for the
repository. It has two sections which will make the whole workflow
work:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"scripts"</code> provides two commands that you can use to
generate a tutorial Template</li>
<li><code>"devDependencies"</code> defines the node modules that will
make all the magic happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step, you will be installing these dependencies, as well
as the services that they rely on.</p>
</details>
</section>
<section id="install-pandoc-and-watchman" aria-labelledby="install-pandoc-and-watchman" data-item="Install Pandoc &amp; Watchman">
<h2>
<a href="#install-pandoc-and-watchman">Install Pandoc and Watchman</a>
</h2>
<p>The HTM-Elves workflow relies on Pandoc, a free open-source software
document converter. It can convert between any of about 60 document
formats, including Markdown and HTML (which is the focus here), but also
PDF, DOCX, PowerPoint, EPUB and many others that you may one day
encounter.</p>
<p>Pandoc is designed to be run from the Command Line, but HTM-Elves
takes care of all the details for you,</p>
<details class="warn" open>
<summary>
Install Pandoc
</summary>
<p>You must [install Pandoc] on your development computer before
continuing. Without Pandoc, there will be no magic.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the <a
href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">installation instructions
here</a>.</strong></p>
</details>
<p>To work most efficiently, it is good to see your Markdown files
converted to HTML files and displayed in your browser in real time. For
this, you can install <a
href="https://facebook.github.io/watchman/">Meta’s open source Watchman
service</a>.</p>
<details class="warn" open>
<summary>
Install Watchman?
</summary>
<p>It’s possible that Watchman has already been installed on your system
by another development tool that you use. To check, run this command in
a Terminal window:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">watchman</span> <span class="at">--version</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you see a response like <code>command not found: watchman</code>,
then you will need to <a
href="https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install">install
Watchman</a> yourself. If you see a version number, like
<code>2024.11.04.00</code>, you’re already set.</p>
</details>
<p>When you have installed these two services, you can install the Node
modules that the HTM-Elves project will use to control them.</p>
<details class="warn" open>
<summary>
Installing Node Modules
</summary>
<p><strong>In a Terminal window open on your
<code>MyTutorials.github.io</code> folder, run the command:</strong></p>
<pre class="bash-#w"><code>npm i</code></pre>
<p>This will tell <code>npm</code> to install all the
<code>devDependencies</code> listed in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</details>
<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>
Ready to Generate a Demo Tutorial
</summary>
<p>If you have succeeded in installing Pandoc, Watchman and the required
Node modules correctly, the fun is about to begin.</p>
</details>
</section>
<section id="a-demo-tutorial" aria-labelledby="a-demo-tutorial" data-item="A Demo Tutorial">
<h2>
<a href="#a-demo-tutorial">A Demo Tutorial</a>
</h2>
<p>As you saw earlier, the <code>package.json</code> file contains a
script called <code>"demo"</code>. It’s time to test it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the Terminal window that you have open on your
<code>MyTutorials.github.io</code> folder, run the command:</p>
<pre class="bash-#w"><code>npm run demo</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>If everything is properly installed, your browser should open showing
a ready-made four-part tutorial. The content is a condensed version of
this tutorial, without all the details.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/RunDemo.webp" alt="npm run demo" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">npm run demo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just like this tutorial that you are reading now, this demo tutorial
has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A menu on the left which collapses to a hamburger if the viewport is
not wide enough to show both the menu and the content.</li>
<li>A toggle button at the top of the menu that allows you to choose
between showing the tutorial as a single page, or split into
sections.</li>
<li>Two links at the foot of the menu (which don’t work yet, because you
haven’t created the associated GitHub repository)</li>
<li>A footer at the end of each section which allows you to navigate to
the next section</li>
<li>Coloured collapsible blocks with information that you can skip over
if you are in a hurry.</li>
<li>The month in which the tutorial was created in the top right
corner.</li>
<li>Numbered and bullet lists, headers and other formatting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-separate-repository">A Separate Repository</h3>
<p>The Demo tutorial has been created in a folder inside the parent
folder shared with your <code>MyTutorials.github.io</code> folder. The
subfolder <code>docs/md/</code> contains a number of Markdown files with
the <code>.md</code> extension.</p>
<p>The Demo folder also contains its own <code>package.json</code> file,
which has its own <code>"scripts"</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dt">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="fu">{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">&quot;pandoc&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;pandoc -o docs/index.html --template=public/template.html docs/md/*.md&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span></span>

<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">}</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>"pandoc"</code> script runs the Markdown-to-HTML conversion
progress. As you’ll see shortly, the <code>"watch"</code> can be used to
run the <code>"pandoc"</code> script every time a Markdown file
changes.</p>
<h3 id="conversion-on-command">Conversion on Command</h3>
<p>The <code>npm run demo</code> command that you typed first created
all these files, and then triggered the <code>"pandoc"</code> command in
the new <code>package.json</code> file. As a result, the file at
<code>docs/index.html</code> was created automatically. It is this
<code>index.html</code> file which is now showing in your browser.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/docs_md.webp" alt="The docs/md/ folder" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The <code>docs/md/</code>

<details class="note" open>
<summary>
Markdown File Numbering System
</summary>
<p>The Markdown files are numbered with zero-padded numbers, to make
sure that they are treated in the correct order. However,
counter-intuitively, the very first file
(<code>99-Introduction.md</code>) has the <em>highest</em> number. This
is because of the way the page sections need to be handled by CSS. This
issue is dealt with in more detail in the tutorial <a
href="https://htm-elves.github.io/Writing-Your-Own-Tutorials/">Writing
Your Own Tutorials</a>.</p>
</details>
<h3 id="reading-from-the-public-folder">Reading from the
<code>public/</code> folder</h3>
<p>The <code>index.html</code> file contains links to files inside the
folder at <code>MyTutorial.github.io/public/</code>. Specifically, it
reads in a number JavaScript files, CSS files, and some SVG icons.</p>
<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>
Summary
</summary>
<p>The <code>npm run demo</code> command also initialized a Git
repository inside the Demo folder, and made a first
<code>commit</code>.</p>
<p>In the next step, you will push this repository to your Tutorials
Organization, so that you can publish the <code>index.html</code> file
with GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>When you write yourself a tutorial, you solidify your own
understanding. When you make your tutorials available to others, you
gain a reputation as someone who gives back to the community, and helps
others foster their own growth.</p>
<p>Web development is a process of continual learning. By showcasing the
whole range of techniques that you master, you make it clear to future
employers and clients that your skills are constantly improving.</p>
<p>This tutorial gives you the tools to make your own tutorial writing
easy.</p>
<h3 id="markdown-to-html">Markdown to HTML</h3>
<p>Markdown is a set of conventions that creates easy-to-read formatted
text. If you open the folder at <code>docs/md/</code>, you will see all
the Markdown files that were used to create this very tutorial. Notice
how the content reads almost like ordinary text, which means that it is
also simple to write.</p>
<p>Here is a quick <a
href="https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2023-06/markdown-crash-course/">tutorial
on writing in Markdown</a>, and a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWWRV6gbA">video tutorial</a> by
the same developer.</p>
<p>The content for this whole site was written in Markdown, and then
converted automatically to HTML. When writing in Markdown, you can focus
on the content. When using the workflow provided by this repository, you
can see the HTML output in real time. That’s the way these pages were
written.</p>

Publishing on GitHub
</summary>
<p>When getting started, you want to reach the widest audience with the
minimum of effort. To do this, you will be publishing your tutorials
directly on GitHub. You will be using your own free GitHub Organization
as the gateway where others can come to find your insights.</p>
