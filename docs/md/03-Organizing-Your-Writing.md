1. You are now ready to start writing your tutorial in Markdown files in the `docs/md/` folder. 
2. Use zero-padded numbering for your `.md` files (e.g.: "01-Getting-Started.md", "02-First-steps.md", ...) to ensure that they are loaded in the correct order.
3. For reasons associated with CSS sibling management, the very _first_ `.md` file should have the _highest_ initial number. That's why the text for `99-Intro.md` appears first. All other files should be numbered in the usual way.
4. Use the root of your new repository to contain the code and assets that demonstrate the finished version of your tutorial
5. Push your repository to GitHub when the tutorial is ready to share.
