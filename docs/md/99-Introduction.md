If this `index.html` page has opened in your browser, then your Markdown to HTML conversion process is working. If this is your first time using the HTM-Elves workflow, then your next step is to publish this tutorial, just as it is, on GitHub. When you have followed the process through to the end, the workflow will become clear. 

This tutorial will explain how to publish this boilerplate tutorial, unchanged, on GitHub.

You can delete this tutorial from GitHub later, after you have understood the publishing process. Alternatively, you can replace all the content in the Markdown files in the `docs/md/` directory with your own files and content, and publish it as a permanent tutorial.

### The Story So Far

In the explanation that follows, I will imagine that you:

1. Created a GitHub Organization called `MyTutorials`
2. Forked the HTM-Elves repository to your Organization, and called your fork `MyTutorials.github.io`
3. Cloned `MyTutorials.github.io` to your development computer
4. Ran `npm run new` in a Terminal window open at the root of your `MyTutorials.github.io` directory.

I also imagine that you will use the name `boilerplate-tutorial` as the name of the GitHub repository that you will create for this tutorial inside your Organization.

Of course, you chose your own names for your Organization and for your tutorial repository. In the instructions that follow, please replace `MyTutorials.github.io` and `boilerplate-tutorial` with the actual names that you have chosen.
