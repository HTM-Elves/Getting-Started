When you write yourself a tutorial, you solidify your own understanding. When you make your tutorials available to others, you gain a reputation as someone who gives back to the community, and helps others foster their own growth.

Web development is a process of continual learning. By showcasing the whole range of techniques that you master, you make it clear to future employers and clients that your skills are constantly improving.

This tutorial gives you the tools to make your own tutorial writing easy.

### Markdown to HTML
Markdown is a set of conventions that creates easy-to-read formatted text. If you open the folder at `docs/md/`, you will see all the Markdown files that were used to create this very tutorial. Notice how the content reads almost like ordinary text, which means that it is also simple to write.

Here is a quick [tutorial on writing in Markdown](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2023-06/markdown-crash-course/), and a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWWRV6gbA) by the same developer.

The content for this whole site was written in Markdown, and then converted automatically to HTML. When writing in Markdown, you can focus on the content. When using the workflow provided by this repository, you can see the HTML output in real time. That's the way these pages were written.
