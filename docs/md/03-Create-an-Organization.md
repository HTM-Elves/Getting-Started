Each tutorial you create will be published from a GitHub repository. To maintain a consistent look and feel, each tutorial repository will share assets, CSS files and JavaScript files with all the others. The HTM-Elves project assumes that you will be storing all your tutorials in a specific GitHub Organization.

To create a GitHub Organization:

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Click on your Profile icon in the top right corner
3. In the drop-down menu that opens, select [Your Organazations](https://github.com/settings/organizations)

1. When you have given all the necessary details and accepted the terms of service, you'll be able to click on the green Next button
2. The next page allows you to invite other GitHub members to join your Organization. If you don't add any names the Complete Setup button makes you skip ahead to the home page of your new Organization.

When GitHub has completed the setup for you, you should find yourself on a page that tells you "We think youâ€™re gonna like it here". Now you are ready to convert your new Organization into a source of tutorials.
