To get your very first placeholder tutorial up online, you're going to need to take 12 steps. I'll list them here quickly, and then deal with each step in detail, one by one.

1. Create your own GitHub Organization.
2. Fork the [HTM-Elves repository](https://github.com/HTM-Elves/HTM-Elves.github.io) into your new Organization.
3. Use GitHub Pages to publish your new fork
4. Clone your fork to your local computer
5. Install Pandoc and Watchman
6. Run `npm run new`
7. Provide a name for your first tutorial repository
8. Create a new GitHub repository inside your new Organization for your first tutorial
9. Set the `origin` for your new local repository to the URL of your new GitHub repository
10. Push your local repository to GitHub
11. Use GitHub Pages to publish this new repository
12. Somewhere between steps 8 and 10, you might want to write some tutorial content of your own, but that's optional, if you just want to understand how the process works.
