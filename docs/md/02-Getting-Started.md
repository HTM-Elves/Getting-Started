2. Fork the [HTM-Elves repository](https://github.com/HTM-Elves/HTM-Elves.github.io) into your new Organization.
3. Use GitHub Pages to publish your new fork
4. Clone your fork to your local computer
5. Generate a Personal Access Token for GitHub
6. Install the Node Modules that HTM-Elves requires
7. Install Pandoc and Watchman locally
8. Use HTM-Elves to generate a Demo tutorial and its associated GitHub repository automatically
9.  Use GitHub Pages to publish this new tutorial repository for the world to see.
